# Island Perimeter Project

## Description

This project aims to calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a grid. The grid is a 2D list of integers where `0` represents water and `1` represents land. The island cells are connected horizontally and vertically (not diagonally). The task is to determine the perimeter of this island.

## Files

- `0-island_perimeter.py`: Contains the `island_perimeter` function which calculates the perimeter of the island.
- `0-main.py`: A script to test the `island_perimeter` function.
